# DiscordStore

I have created this project under effect from this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_arQ-6ElYI). 

This is a Rust application that takes some directory and splits it into chunks of 10 MBs. It uploads them to Discord to create an unlimited file storage. 

As 17/02/25 it does not function on Discord, but I majorly succeeded with local file splitting.
