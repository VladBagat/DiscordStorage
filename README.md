# DiscordStore

**DiscordStore** is a Rust application that demonstrates how to use Discord as an unlimited file storage. It takes an arbitrary directory, splits it into 8 MB chunks, and uploads those chunks to Discord.

Created with inspiration from this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_arQ-6ElYI).

## Usage

1. You will need your own Discord token for app to work. For that you will need to create an app/bot. You can see the [official guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started).
   
3. You need a discord server with your bot there. Use this [link generator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html). Enable Administrator permission (8).
   
5. Place binary `discordstore.exe` in any folder you have read/write access to and run it. Follow the instructions until the bot will be set up.
   
7. Use !info for further guidance

## Warning 

This software may violate Discord's Terms of Service if used extensively. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate Discord's capabilities as a file storage medium, not make it a permanent solution for large files. Please use it responsibly.
